        <h1>Design Process</h1>

        <h2>User Research Method</h2>
        <p>
            Research mainly revolves around “needfinding,” actively researching and identifying the specific needs 
            and pain points of potential users.
        </p>
        <p> 
            This is done through observational methods using design ethnography to observe users in their natural 
            environment to understand behaviors, needs, and experiences. <b>Design ethnography</b> is applied through 
            <b>contextual inquiry</b> to see behaviors in real contexts to gain insight into daily interactions.
            Another research method is conducting <b>interviews</b>. 
            
        </p>
        <p>
            Ideally, we would like to get qualitative and 
            quantitative data through surveys; however, this is a sensitive topic within this community, so we rely on 
            interviews with family members. Our main research methods revolve around responses from family 
            members and observing them in real contexts, such as going grocery shopping with them to observe their 
            pain points in daily interactions</p>
        </p>

        <h2>Proposed Research Method</h2>
        <p>The main research method is <b>contextual inquiry</b>. The activities we intended to observe are:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Where does a user go on a daily basis?</li><br>
                <li>With whom does the user interact on a daily basis outside of his/her family?</li><br>
                <li>How often does a user utilize mobile applications for translations, interactive games?</li>
            </ol>

        <p><b>The focus of each observed activity is:</b></p>
            <ol>
                <li>To determine the specific context and category of words users mostly use. For example, the 
                    category of words in a grocery store (food, beverages) will differ than a clothing store (articles of 
                    clothing, sizes)</li><br>
                <li>To determine the range of proficiency among those with whom the user interacts. For example, 
                    the user will have varying difficulty based on speaking with a native English speaker compared to 
                    another immigrant. The other immigrant may be from a different country, but both rely on 
                    English as an intermediary</li><br>
                <li>To determine which mobile applications the user already uses (Google Translate, DuoLingo, 
                    Babbel) and the frequency. This will narrow down most important features and how receptive a 
                    user is to using mobile applications like ours</li>
            </ol>


        <p><b>What We Learned:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Word categories pertaining to stores are the most crucial. This may include asking where 
                    something is and common questions at checkout like “cash or credit?” Grocery shopping is not 
                    unique to this community, as everyone frequently gets groceries weekly, but what is unique is the 
                    difficulty in communicating at grocery stores or clothing stores</li><br>
                <li>Users have difficulty interacting with other immigrants or refugees just as frequently as they do 
                    with native English speakers. Many presume this community only has difficulty speaking with 
                    Americans, but they also have trouble with other immigrants, such as at church events. There are 
                    varying nuances and dialects. For example, Spanish in Puerto Rico or the Dominican Republic 
                    varies from Spanish spoken in Spain. Even within Spain, many Spaniards do not understand the 
                    unique Basque dialect. This is also observable in Arabic speakers as the Egyptian dialect is vastly 
                    different than the Levant region, for example</li><br>
                <li>Users are more prone to utilize translation applications when they are alone. For example, if an 
                    immigrant mother is with her children who were born in the U.S., she is more likely to turn to her 
                    children to translate than using a mobile application. However, if she is by herself, she will likely 
                    use a translation applicatio</li><br>
                <li>Mobile applications like DuoLingo or Babbel are actually underutilized. Users prefer to watch 
                    movies or YouTube with subtitles to learn words because videos are a more entertaining medium. 
                    This is not the most effective way to learn new words, though, because the user is not challenged 
                    to be fully immersed. We aim to make TranslateMate an entertaining application so users enjoy 
                    learning new words without “cheating” and using subtitles</li><br>
                <li> Users who performed well in school while learning English as a foreign still struggle when they 
                    come to the U.S. Foreign language classes are very formal and many struggle when they come 
                    here because of colloquial English. We aim to use colloquial English in the Random Word Generator
                    feature to expose users to different vernacular</li><br>
                <li> Users feel embarrassed using translation features in public, but are more receptive to interactive 
                    games while they are home. Although the Translation feature of our application is the primary 
                    feature, this indicates that just as much attention needs to be given to the Random Word Generator and 
                    Crossword features</li>
            </ul>
