        <h2>Research Method</h2>
        <p>The main research method is <b>contextual inquiry</b>. The activities we intended to observe are:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Where does a user go on a daily basis?</li><br>
                <li>With whom does the user interact on a daily basis outside of his/her family?</li><br>
                <li>How often does a user utilize mobile applications for translations, interactive games?</li>
            </ol>
            
        <h2>Main Goals</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Facilitate simple, quick, on-the-spot translations for users through daily routines</li><br>
                <li>Enhance usersâ€™ vocabulary acquisition through Word Generator and Dictionary features</li><br>
                <li>Provide users interactive games, such as a Crossword Puzzle feature, to practice vocabulary and 
                    sentence comprehension</li>
            </ul>


        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Creating Translate Mate was a rewarding and insightful project that combined technology and language to fix a lingering issue for immigrants and refugees who struggle with language barriers. Through the development process, we gained a deeper understanding of user interface design and the importance of accessibility in app development. The app not only provides real-time translations across multiple languages but also aims to foster cross-cultural communication and understanding. The app also includes 4 different methods of learning, which helped us visualize what can be done to fix this issue. This project highlighted how technology can be a powerful tool in making the world more connected</p>
