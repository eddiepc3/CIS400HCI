            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                We developed a Translator App, a mobile application whose target audience is the immigrant
                and refugee community as part of the theme, “Designing for Diversity.” There are many daily challenges
                this community faces that many take for granted due to a language barrier. There are varying levels of
                proficiency in English, but all in the community still face similar daily challenges because English is not
                their first language. English proficiency can range from a graduate student, who is fluent in English and
                their own language, to one of our grandmothers who does not speak English at all. The app can enhance
                any user’s vocabulary, but we are specifically looking through the lens of the immigrant and refugee
                community in our design development.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our primary Translator feature will help with daily routines, but additional features encourage users to learn
                new vocabulary and to practice through interactive games. A Word Generator feature will encourage users to
                enhance their vocabulary by swiping through a randomly generated list. Users can also search for words in the Dictionary feature. After learning more
                words, eventually users will be able to progress to sentences and apply sentences to crossword puzzle
                clues.
